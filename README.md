# Text-to-Speech Python Script

This repository contains a simple Python script that uses the `win32com.client` library to convert text input into speech. The script continuously prompts the user for input and speaks the text using the Windows Speech API (SAPI). The loop terminates when the user inputs 'quit'.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you need to have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- `pywin32` library

You can install the `pywin32` library using pip:

pip install pywin32
